# xslt-xml

## How to build and run

1. Clone the project using git to a location on your computer
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (I've used Intellij Community Edition)
3. Create an executable jar by running the command `./gradlew deployApp`
4. Find the newly created executable jar file in the <projectlocation>/build/fxlauncher directory
5. Doubleclick fxlauncher.jar

Now you should be up and running.
